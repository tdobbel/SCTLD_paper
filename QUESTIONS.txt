# LEW

TD: Would it be possible to have some references regarding bottom current parametrization ?

# ERINN

TD: Would it be possible to get the data used to plot the upper graph of Fig. 2 in order to merge two plots into one graph ?
TD: If I remember well, the transmission experiments performed showed a transmission time of ~10.5 days ? Is that so ? And can we cite/use these results to support the 6.45 days obtained by model fitting to observations ?
TD: What about the ballast water team ?

# ALL

TD: Do we have any idea of time needed for organic matter degradation by seawater ? That might be useful for the discussion about our LPT experiments.
TD: How can we analyze the fact that infection threshold I0 is fairly low (0.05%-0.1%) from a biological point of view
TD: If causative agent is transported by neutrally buoyant materials, what are the likely vector candidates ?
TD: How do our results compare with the study of Rosales et al ?
    * Are our results consistent with Rhodobacterales and Rhizobiales ?
    * Are our results consistent with the fact that those bacteria are found in sediments ?
