# Structure

## Introduction

## Methods

### Modeling the exchanges of infectious material between reefs

### Epidemiological modeling

#### Model equations
#### Calibration of model coefficients
#### Intialization of the model
#### Computation of front displacement rate

## Results
Ideally, 4-5 results. For each one, illustration with fig or table
### Exchanges of infected materials
1. Connectivity indicators &rarr; table

### Epidemiological model results
2. Calibaration as a result
3. Barotropic currents give best match
3. I<sub>0</sub>: plateau/optimal interval &rarr; Fig 2
4. Trajectories of particles (why surface and bottom currents give less optimal results) &rarr; Fig 3

## Discussion and conclusions (structure should be reordered)

* ยง1 : Summary of main take-home messages (ideally 3)
  1. Values of parameters of epidemiological model
  2. Barotropic currents give best match
  2. Impact of I<sub>0</sub>
* ยง2-4 : Each of three messages discussed. Comparison with results of other studies on same topic. Explain whether it matches with current knowledge.
* ยง 5-6 : limitations and improvement
* ยง 7 : End on positive note. Explain how questions of intro have been answered. Explain how our results help management of this type of epidemic (in Florida and elsewhere)
