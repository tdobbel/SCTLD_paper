# Structure

## Introduction

## Methods

### Modeling the exchanges of infectious material between reefs

### Epidemiological modeling

#### Model equations
#### Calibration of model coefficients
#### Intialization of the model
#### Computation of front displacement rate

## Results

### Exchanges of infected meterials
    * Comparison of connectivity indicators between current types

### Epidemiological model results
    * Description of simulation summary
    * Link between model results and particle trajectories
    * Impact of Vaca reef

## Discussion and conclusions

    * Impact of settlement rate &gamma; (if changed &rArr; minor effect on model conclusions)
    * Discussion about I<sub>0</sub>
    * Potential model improvements
      * Division into highly/intermediately/weakly susceptible populations
      * Use coral coverage
