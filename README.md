# Structure

## Introduction

## Methods

### Modeling the exchanges of infectious material between reefs

### Epidemiological modeling

#### Model equations
#### Calibration of model coefficients
#### Intialization of the model
#### Computation of front displacement rate

## Results

### Exchanges of infected materials
1. Connectivity indicators &rarr; table

### Epidemiological model results
2. Calibaration as a result &rarr; Fig. 3
3. Barotropic currents give best match &rarr; Fig. 4
3. I<sub>0</sub>: plateau/optimal interval &rarr; Fig. 4
4. Trajectories of particles (why surface and bottom currents do not spread the disease realistically) &rarr; Fig. 5

## Discussion and conclusions (structure should be reordered)

* ยง1 : Summary of main take-home messages
  1. Values of parameters of epidemiological mode
  2. Barotropic currents give best match
  3. Impact of I<sub>0</sub>
* ยง2-4 : Each of three messages discussed. Comparison with results of other studies on same topic. Explain whether it matches with current knowledge.
* ยง 5-6 : Limitations and improvement
  1. Limitations of 2d model
  2. Improvement of epidemiological model
     	* Division into highly/intermediately/weakly susceptible corals
     	* Use coral coverage
* ยง 7 : End on positive note. Explain how questions of intro have been answered. Explain how our results help management of this type of epidemic (in Florida and elsewhere)
